# Module 4: Object Detection with YOLO (Part 2)

## Overview

In this advanced module, you'll learn how to fine-tune YOLO models for custom object detection tasks. You'll understand how to prepare your own datasets, train custom models, and evaluate their performance for specific use cases.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn to prepare custom datasets for YOLO training
- Understand data annotation and formatting requirements
- Fine-tune pre-trained YOLO models on custom data
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Optimize models for specific deployment scenarios

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Dataset Preparation

Run `prepare_custom_dataset.py` to learn how to format data for YOLO training.

### Exercise 2: Custom Model Training

Run `train_custom_yolo.py` to fine-tune YOLO on your dataset.

### Exercise 3: Model Evaluation

Run `evaluate_yolo_model.py` to assess model performance.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset:

   ```bash
   python prepare_custom_dataset.py
   ```

3. Train custom model:

   ```bash
   python train_custom_yolo.py
   ```
